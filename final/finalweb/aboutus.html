   <h2>Created by Friends, Built for Nature Lovers</h2>

      We're just five friends who fell in love with <b>Big Sur.</b> The misty mornings, the endless trails, the quiet moments you can't quite put into words. Over the years, our camping trips became a tradition. We'd do morning yoga, hike, kayak, watch the birds, sit around a fire, and talk about how special this place felt. We wanted others to experience that same feeling.
      <br>
      <br>
      That's how <span class="resort">Pacific Trails Resort</span> began.
        <img id="yurtphoto" img src="images/insideplant.jpg" alt="Inside of a yurt with plants" class="insideplant" width="300" height="200">
      <br>
      <br>
      We created a place where people can unplug, slow down, and reconnect with nature and each other. Our luxury yurts are at the heart of that experience. They're not just tents; they're cozy retreats with all the comforts you need to enjoy the great outdoors without sacrificing comfort.
      
      

      Inside you'll find a queen-sized bed with down quilts, a gas stove, and modern touches like electricity, hot and cold running water, and a private sink. Unlike typical camping, our yurts offer a peaceful blend of rustic charm and home-like comfort, with roof domes that open so you can stargaze right from your bed. 
      <br>
      <br>
      What makes our yurts special isn't just the comfort, but the feeling they create... waking up to the sound of birds, stepping into the cool forest air, and ending your day with a sky full of stars. It's a chance to escape the noise of everyday life and find peace in the simple things.
         
        
      <br>

      <strong>Outside, the world is yours to explore.</strong>
      
      
      
      <br>
      <br>

      <span class="resort">Pacific Trails Resort</span> isn't just about slowing down, exploring hiking trails, kayaking in the ocean, or watching birds at sunrise.
      
      It's about creating memories that last a lifetime. It's about finding joy in the little things, like the sound of leaves crunching underfoot, the smell of pine trees, and the warmth of a campfire on a cool evening.
      <br>
      <br>
      We hope you leave feeling <i>refreshed, grounded,</i> and a little more <i>connected to the world</i> around you. Whether you're here with friends, family, or flying solo, we invite you to experience the magic of Big Sur with us.
